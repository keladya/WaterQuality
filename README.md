# Water Quality Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing water quality based on pH values and other chemical properties from data sourced from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on understanding the composition and variability of river water quality and explores the relationships between different water quality parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's [Water Quality Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanthanadevi08/water-quality-prediction) dataset, which includes various parameters such as pH, conductivity, nitrate, sulfate, and others. The data is filtered to focus on specific sampling instances to facilitate a more granular analysis.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this repository are to:
- Analyze the composition of river water quality based on pH levels.
- Explore the variability of water quality parameters.
- Determine the relationship between pH and other chemical properties in the dataset.
